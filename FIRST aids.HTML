                At the Red Cross, first aid training prepares you to provide care to both children and adults during times of crisis. However, like many things, if you don't use your skills frequently, they're easy to forget. That's why, when you take our first aid certification classes, you'll also receive free online access to our first aid refreshers and a printable list of the basic steps for performing first aid. This way, you can practice your skills regularly, and keep reminders in the places you might need them most, like in the first aid kit in your car, home, or desk

            <h2>What is First Aid?</h2>
                <p>First aid refers to medical attention that is usually administered immediately after the injury occurs and at the location where it occurred. It often consists of a one-time, short-term treatment and requires little technology or training to administer. First aid can include cleaning minor cuts, scrapes, or scratches; treating a minor burn; applying bandages and dressings; the use of non-prescription medicine; draining blisters; removing debris from the eyes; massage; and drinking fluids to relieve heat stress. OSHA's revised recordkeeping rule, which went into effect January 1, 2002, does not require first aid cases to be documented. For example: A worker goes to the first-aid room and has a dressing applied to a minor cut by a registered nurse. Although the registered nurse is a health care professional, the employer does not have to report the accident because the worker simply received first aid. The selected references below provide more information on first aid.
